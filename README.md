A web-based **Fitness Club Management System** built with **Flask** and **SQLite**.  
This app allows gym administrators to manage members, trainers, classes, payments, and check-ins, with automated membership reminders and dashboards for key statistics.

##  Understanding the System

**This is a staff-facing management system for fitness club employees, NOT a public membership portal.** Here's how it works:

- **For Members:** People sign up IN PERSON at the physical gym location
- **For Staff:** Gym employees use this system to manage member accounts, track payments, schedule classes, and handle check-ins
- **Member Access:** Members don't log into this system - they get physical access cards and staff manages their accounts

## Staff Member Workflow:
1. **Login** with staff credentials
2. **Add New Members** when people sign up at front desk
3. **Process Payments** for membership fees
4. **Schedule Classes** and assign trainers
5. **Track Check-ins** as members arrive
6. **Send Reminders** for expiring memberships

## Typical Member Journey:
1. üë§ Signs up IN PERSON at gym
2. üìù Staff creates account in this system
3. üí≥ Pays membership fee at front desk
4. üèãÔ∏è Gets physical access card/key fob
5. ‚úÖ Checks in by scanning card at gym entrance
6. üì± Receives SMS reminders (simulated) when membership nears expiry
